notes of chapter 1

1. Fielddata is disabled on text fields by default. Set fielddata=true on [interests] in order to load fielddata in memory by uninverting the inverted index. Note that this can however use significant memory. Alternatively use a keyword field instead.
2. Some users may be accustomed to shutting down Elasticsearch using the _shutdown API. This API has been removed from Elasticsearch version 2.x and up.
