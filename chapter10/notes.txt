notes for chapter 10

1. "[include_in_all] is not allowed for indices created on or after version 6.0.0 as [_all] is deprecated. As a replacement, you can use an [copy_to] on mapping fields to create your own catch all field."
2. _id is not configurable in ES 6.0.0
3. "search_type" -> "scan" is no longer supported in ES 6.0.0
